# Hi, I’m Oluwatomilola 👋

I’m a frontend developer focused on building clean, usable, and production-ready web applications.
I recently graduated and I’m currently in a dedicated builder phase — strengthening my frontend stack, shipping real projects, and preparing for internships and entry-level roles.

I care deeply about clarity, consistency, and finishing what I start.

🚀 What I’m Currently Working On

Building portfolio-grade frontend projects with React and TypeScript

Strengthening core JavaScript and frontend fundamentals

Integrating Web3 concepts (smart contracts, wallets, on-chain data) into practical apps

Learning Rust gradually for long-term systems thinking

Applying for frontend internships and junior roles

🧠 Tech Stack & Tools

Frontend

React

TypeScript

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS

Web3

Solidity

Ethers / Wagmi / Viem

Smart contract basics & testnets

Tools & Workflow

Git & GitHub

Vite

Foundry (for smart contracts)

REST APIs

Basic testing & debugging

🛠 How I Work

I prioritize real output over busy work

Every learning session produces an artifact (code, commit, feature, or documentation)

I build projects incrementally, refactor intentionally, and document decisions

I value readable code, simple architecture, and sustainable pace

📌 Featured Projects

You’ll find here:

Frontend applications focused on real user problems

Projects demonstrating state management, async data handling, and clean UI

Web3-integrated apps that connect frontend logic with smart contracts

Each serious project includes:

A clear README

Thoughtful trade-offs

Evidence of iteration

🌱 What I’m Learning Next

Advanced React patterns

Performance and accessibility

Better frontend architecture

Rust fundamentals (slow and steady)
